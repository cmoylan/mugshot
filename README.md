# Mugshot

A blame tool in Python and GTK

## Overview
Mugshot takes an RSS feed from a continous integration service and uses this to
determint the status of the build. If the build is broken, it displays an 
embarassing picture of the person who committed the offending code. It is
intended to run on a large monitor prominently placed for all to see.

## Implementation
Mugshot uses Python and GTK via PyGTK.

## Misc
Craeted by Chris Moylan for no purpose other than embarassing coworkers.
