# Mugshot

A blame tool in Python and GTK

## Overview
Mugshot takes an RSS feed from a continous integration service. If the build
is broken, it displays an embarassing picture of the person who committed the 
offending code. It is intended to run on a large monitor prominently placed
for all to see.

## Implementation
Mugshot uses Python and GTK via PyGTK.

## Usage
python lib/mugshot.py

## Credits

## Misc
Created by Chris Moylan for no purpose other than embarassing coworkers.
